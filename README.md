# About

This workbook is a learning project as part of the video course ["Microsoft Excel Tutorial for Beginners - Full Course"](https://youtu.be/Vl0H-qTclOg?t=4994) on the freeCodeCamp Youtube channel. I practiced several techniques in Excel and also learned a couple of new tricks I've been looking to add to my repertoire.

## Vlookup

This tutorial included a problem in which an entry's ID number needed to be split into several fields in order to not only decipher what the vehicle was, but also create a new set of ID numbers for the vehicles. We started by creating a "look up table" below the data detailing what each abbreviation meant and then used `code`vlookup`code` to fill in a field of vehicle makes. We did the same thing for vehicle model names.
